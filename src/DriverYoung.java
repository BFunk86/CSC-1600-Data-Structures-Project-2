 * The DriverYoung class demonstrates the new NoDuplicateQueueYoung Queue
 *
 * Consider a new kind of queue that allows only a single copy of an object in the queue. If an object is added to the
 * queue, but it is already there, leave the queue unchanged. This queue has another operation moveToBack that takes
 * an object in the queue and moves it to the back. If an object is not in the queue, the operation adds it at the back
 * of the queue. The size of queue should increase if it is full.
 *
 * Create an interface NoDuplicatesQueueInterface that extends QueueInterface and save as
 * NoDuplicatesQueueInterfaceYourLastName.java. Then write an array-based implementation of NoDuplicatesQueue and save
 * as NoDuplicatesQueueYourLastName.java. Finally, write a program that adequately demonstrates your new class and save
 * as DriverYourLastName.java.
